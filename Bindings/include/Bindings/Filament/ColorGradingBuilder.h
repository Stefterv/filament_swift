 * Each output channel can add or subtract data from the source channel by using values

 *
 * Using the channel mixer adjustment you can for instance create a monochrome output

 * the beginning and end of the transition from mid-tones to highlights.

 * A smooth transition is applied between the zones which means for instance that the
 * correction color of the shadows range will partially apply to the mid-tones, and the
 * other way around. This ensure smooth visual transitions in the final image.
 *
