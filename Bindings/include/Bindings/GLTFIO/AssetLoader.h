/**
 * Consumes the contents of a glTF 2.0 file and produces a primary asset with one or more
 * instances. The primary asset has ownership over the instances.
 *
 * The returned instances share their textures, material instances, and vertex buffers with the
 * primary asset. However each instance has its own unique set of entities, transform
 * components, and renderable components. Instances are freed when the primary asset is freed.
 *
 * Light components are not instanced, they belong only to the primary asset.
 *
 * Clients must use ResourceLoader to load resources on the primary asset.
 *
 * The entity accessor and renderable stack API in the primary asset can be used to control the
 * union of all instances. The individual FilamentInstance objects can be used to access each
 * instance's partition of entities.  Similarly, the Animator in the primary asset controls all
 * instances. To animate instances individually, use FilamentInstance::getAnimator().

 * gradually add them to the scene as needed. Instances can also be "recycled" by removing and
 * re-adding them to the scene.
 *
 * NOTE: destroyInstance() does not exist because gltfio favors flat arrays for storage of
 * entity lists and instance lists, which would be slow to shift. We also wish to discourage
 * create/destroy churn, as noted above.
